# SDLpp

## Description

These are my C++ bindings to SDL2. They are intended to encapsulate
common functionality in an RAII fashion so that SDL structs are
destroyed when the container object goes out of scope.

## Dependencies

The library fully utilizes C++11 constructs such as initializer lists,
`unique_ptr`, move semantics, and the like so a modern C++ compiler is
necessary. In addition, the library links against `SDL2`,
`SDL2_image`, and `SDL2_ttf`.

## Building

The project requires Cmake > v2.8.11 although an older Cmake is likely
to work and creates a shared library.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will create an `libSDLpp.so` library that your application can
link against. Remember to add the `include` directory as well. In
addition, this will build all the examples in the `examples`
directory.

Alternatively, if you're a windows user, you can build with
visual studio by building the solution under the 'VisualC' directory.
This will create an 'SDLpp.lib' library that your application can
link against. Remember to add the 'include' directory as well.
In addition, this will build all examples in the 'examples' directory.

## Usage

Please refer to individual examples in the `examples` directory for
usage instructions.
